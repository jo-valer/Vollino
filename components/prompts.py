- 'buy_merchandise': if the user wants to buy merchandise
- 'matches_schedule': if the user wants to see the matches schedule
- 'get_news': if the user wants to get news

- 'out_of_domain': if the user asks for something outside the scope of the assistant or does not express a clear intent

Chunk only if necessary! Typically, the user has a single intent, so the chunk is the full user input.
